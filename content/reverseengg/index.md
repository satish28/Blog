## Reverse Engineering - Why this Blog

Alright there are a lot of blogs, tutorials, guides which are there to help people learn reverse engineering. This blog series is not trying to be an online tutorial. 

### What it is

I intend to use this blog to keep track of my learning and hold myself accountable in the process of learning. I have been wanting to learn reverse engineering to better understand how programs work for more than 3 years now. Whenever i see my colleagues talk about assembly language etc i am always in awe and inspired to learn. But the inspiration vanishes in the first 15 minutes of trying to learn. 

By writing a series of articles about my journey i am hoping to learn and at the time help anyone who might come across this blog series.

#### Structure of this series (Informal)

Current plan is to first address the following questions.

* What are registers and their uses.
* Basic assembly (x86-64) syntax.
* What is a Stack 
* What is a Heap
* Get comfortable with GDB or Radare or Ghidra. I have never used any of the debugging tools in details so i am not sure what to use either.
* Start will small C Programs and use a debugger to understand how the code gets converted into assembly language.
