## Day - 9

A slower recovery run. Good Start for the month. This month target is regain the endurance and speed. Hot + humid and i guess i should stop saying this everyday. The weather is going to remain the same or get even hotter as May progress. 

Aim for today's run is not to look at the watch untill the end of run and run only based on the effort and feel. Felt very relaxing and most runs should be of this effort.

#### Perceived Effort

A very very relaxed effort. HR monitor got it wrong the last km. Pace was the slowest and HR was at 150 :P. 14 KM HR was at 139-144.

##### Things to Work
