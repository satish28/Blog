## Day - 1

A slow recovery run. Aim was to keep the heart rate under < 140bpm. 

#### Perceived Effort

Even though the pace was slower than usual by 30secs per km, it felt a bit harder effort. A lot of rolling hills, have to get used to it. Legs feel fine, the continous incline and decline stresses the mind. 

##### Things to Work

* It's all in the mind. Be OK with being uncomfortable.
* Recovery -- Need to work on streching.
