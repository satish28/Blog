## Day - 2

1st Km warm up. Next 12 km run in the MAF Heart Range 139bpm - 149bpm. 

#### Perceived Effort

Relaxed effort for first 9kms. Once the T-Shirt gets soaked in sweat it interferes with the HR monitor and that distracts the concentration from the run. 

##### Things to improve

* It's all in the mind. Be OK with being uncomfortable.
* Recovery -- Need to work on streching.
* Sweat Management Stratergy - Take a spare T-Shirt and change during the run post 9kms.
