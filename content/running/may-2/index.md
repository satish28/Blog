## Day - 10

A slower recovery run. Humid again, when the sweaty tshirt is sticking to the HR monitor HR is high by 4-5 beats. As soon as the tshirt is taken out HR drops by 4 secs. Slightly harder workout with all the U-Turns, normal turns etc. Want to do a Out and Back run. Tomorrow going to try a 2 Hr run.

#### Perceived Effort

Screwed around the run today. Ran zig-zag no constant loop, ran here there, everywhere :). Lots of small incline, decline U-turns , sharp turns. Legs got tired at the end .

##### Things to Work

* Have more fun in the run. 
* Build strength and Stamina.
